# Question 1

Markup lanaguages that are used in webdevelopment are HTML, XML, SGML, XHTML they are used to help structure and build a website. Anything you see on a website from headings, articles, links, and even images are created using these markup languages. The purpose of these languages is help organise and layout how your website will be presented online. There are many components and concepts to these languages and specfic steps to take.

## Components/Concepts

## Doctypes 

### Doctypes HTML help identify which HTML document it's coded in, the purpose is to communicate with the browser so it knows what should be on shown your website. Doctypes will always be the first line of code you should see. 

- HTML5 is the most reccent version and is the one that is reccomended, you can identify this doctype by seeing this code:
"< !DOCTYPE html >" HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.10 are the other docutypes you may see in HTML but it can be more complex and complicated. You can also identify these by seeing: 
" < !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC > ", " < !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "> 



## Tags

## HTML is structured by using different elements one of these elements are called "tags" A tag must start with an opening tag and finish with a closing tag. 

- "< header >" This tag is for your main header, usually the indicator of what the website is called.

- "< title >" This will be the name of the website and will apear in the title bar.

- "< body > " This is where all your content that is not a footer or a header should be placed.

- "< h 1 >" This is used to make smaller subheadings, you can use up to 6 different tags! For example h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6.

- "< p >" This is for paragraphs big or small! for bigger and blog type text you can also use "< article >"

- " < a >" This is used to add links for a example if you have a nav bar you can send them to your next html page or a completely different site. 

- "< div >" This is used so you can organise all your other tags into one container. You can also use " < div class ="Chocolate"> " to help style your content in CSS.

- "< img >" This is used to display images on your page, you will also need to use the "< alt >" tag to show where the content is from. 

## CSS 
### Cascading style sheet is a very powerful and important part in HTML, with CSS you can go from changing your font colour/size to even creating borders on images. You can do many creative things with CSS, the great thing about CSS is it's ability to have several style sheets for each page. Using CSS will make your website more engaging and attractive. 

- To use CSS in HTML you must always link each style sheet individually using " < link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> " into your " < head > " tag or the CSS will not be applied to your website. 


# Question 2

### Packets

- It is data that comes together with other data, it then gets sent to a computer network. Each packet has it's own job to be a part of a message to become a bigger message, this message carries important address information. Packets have limits as to how much data can be sent through each packet individually, that is why they come together to become bigger.


### IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)

- IP stands for Internet Protocol, this is where the Packets of data move through and communicate so it is sent to the correct location. If you are sending something from one place to another these Packets of Data will break down, each packet will have IP, or the Packets will go to the wrong location.

- Every device will come with it's own IP address to help identify who it belongs to or where it is located. Packets of Data cannot route properly without an IP, this is why IP adresses are so important. 

- IPv4 is one of the popular IP adresses used for devices, it is simple because it has a wide range for being used on many different electronic devices. The data that is quite large in the packets through IPv4 is broken down, this makes it easier for information to be sent through. 

- With IPv4 being used by a lot of people and the internet becoming so massive technologist had to make the decision to bring in a Network Address Translation. This helped shape how many devices at once you can have under a private/public IP address. 

- IPv6 isn't massively different to IPv4 but it is more advanced and better, you have bigger space for your IP address and better security for your more advanced devices. You can have a lot of different IP address that are different, if you are connected to a IP address that is under IPv6 you can customise the network settings. Overall it's better for our current generation, due to mobile devices that are connect to a IPv6 address will have decent security. 

### Routers and routing

- Routers are used to get any network device to connect to the internet. 

- Routing is the reason IP packets can go from network to network. 

### Domains and DNS
