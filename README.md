# Question 1

- Markup languages that are used in web development are HTML, XML, SGML, and XHTML they are used to help structure and build a website. Anything you see on a website from headings, articles, links, and even images is created using these markup languages. The purpose of these languages is to help organize and lay out how your website will be presented online. There are many components and concepts to these languages and specific steps to take.

# Components/Concepts

## Doctypes 

- Doctypes HTML helps identify which HTML document it's coded in; the purpose is to communicate with the browser so it knows what should be on shown your website. Doctypes will always be the first line of code you should see. 

- HTML5 is the most recent version and is the one that is recommended, you can identify this doctype by seeing this code:
"< !DOCTYPE html >" HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.10 are the other doctypes you may see in HTML but they can be more complex and complicated. You can also identify these by seeing: 
" < !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC > ", " < !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "> 


## Tags

- HTML is structured by using different elements one of these elements is called "tags" A tag must start with an opening tag and finish with a closing tag. 

- "< header >" This tag is for your main header, usually the indicator of what the website is called.

- "< title >" This will be the name of the website and will appear in the title bar.

- "< body > " This is where all your content that is not a footer or a header should be placed.

- "< h 1 >" This is used to make smaller subheadings; you can use up to 6 different tags! For example, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6.

- "< p >" This is for paragraphs big or small! for the bigger and blog-type text, you can also use "< article >"

- " < a >" This is used to add links for example if you have a nav bar you can send them to your next HTML page or a completely different site. 

- "< div >" This is used so you can organize all your other tags into one container. You can also use " < div class ="Chocolate"> " to help style your content in CSS.

- "< img >" This is used to display images on your page, you will also need to use the "< alt >" tag to show where the content is from. 

## CSS 
 - Cascading style sheet is a very powerful and important part of HTML, with CSS you can go from changing your font color/size to even creating borders on images. You can do many creative things with CSS, the great thing about CSS is its ability to have several style sheets for each page. Using CSS will make your website more engaging and attractive. 

- To use CSS in HTML you must always link each style sheet individually using " < link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> " into your " < head > " tag or the CSS will not be applied to your website.

# Question 2

### Packets

- It's data that comes together with other data, it then gets sent to a computer network. Each packet has its job to be a part of a message to become a bigger message, this message carries important address information. Packets have limits as to how much data can be sent through each packet individually, which is why they come together to become bigger. Packets are a huge part of helping data transfer, without packets data can't break down and run through more than one path. This is essential as data can be in big chunks, the bigger it is the harder the transfer will be. 

### IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)

- IP stands for Internet Protocol, this is where the Packets of data move through and communicate so it is sent to the correct location. If you are sending something from one place to another these Packets of Data will break down, each packet will have IP, or the Packets will go to the wrong location.

- Every device will come with its IP address to help identify who it belongs to or where it is located. Packets of Data cannot route properly without an IP, this is why IP addresses are so important. We use IP addresses daily and it is the reason why we can use the internet. 

- IPv4 is one of the popular IP addresses used for devices, it is simple because it has a wide range for being used on many different electronic devices. The data that is quite large in the packets through IPv4 is broken down, which makes it easier for information to be sent through. 

- IPv6 isn't massively different from IPv4 but it is more advanced and better, you have bigger space for your IP address and better security for your more advanced devices. You can have a lot of different IP addresses that are different, if you are connected to an IP address that is under IPv6 you can customize the network settings. Overall, it's better for our current generation, due to mobile devices that are connected to an IPv6 address will have decent security. 

### Routers and routing

- A router is a device that receives packets and sends them from one location to another, this creates a local network connection. You can connect many devices at once with a router, it will usually find the best path. A router will still require you to have a modem as the job of the modem is to connect to the signal of your internet provider/phone company. Routers create a stable wireless connection that helps improve the internet connection. The main reason why a router can be essential is the extra protection and gateways that a modem cannot provide.

- Routing is what makes a router run successfully, it starts a route that sends data packets through to a node. The node becomes the sender, it will then communicate with another node to transfer data to a router that is nearby. Routing has three main purposes Static Routing, Dynamic Routing, and Default Routing. 

### Domains and DNS

- DNS stands for Domain Name System it works like a main source that has information, it communicates with the IP address. DNS has the job of making websites load their resources, without it we would need to memorize our IP address. This also requires four steps the first is the DNS recusor, which works as a server searching for queries from a device. The second is the root server which transfers hostnames to an IP address. The third step is the TLD nameserver this will search for the right IP address and become a host, it will host the end of the address name. The last step is the Authoritative nameserver, this part is when everything comes together for it to work it must have access to the very original request, it will then successfully communicate with the Rector.

# Question 3

- Different types of technologies are essential to make web development possible. The ones that contribute to the development of client and server communication are TCP, HTTP, HTTPS, Request Methods, Rendering, and Developer tools. 

### TCP

- TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, its purpose is to be the messenger and works with the internet protocol. TCP is the reason information is sent through multiple network devices; it is that little boost to make sure information is accurate. It is effective by breaking down the big groups of data making information simple and having a smooth flow control. It contributes by making sure all the information going to the correct destination, the TCP chooses the right IP address for every device connected to the network.   

### HTTP and HTTPS

- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol it is the soul of the World Wide Web, it works as a link so you can view any webpage you like. HTTP is a client-server protocol that makes it possible for it to function correctly, it will piece the different recourses together. HTTP has come a long way since the 90s and with the ability to show more than just a text article HTTP can display images and videos. This all starts with a request that is successfully sent to the client-server protocol, this will then come up with a response, this is when proxies come into the process. HTTP is not a safe option if you want to broadcast your sensitive information because it is a different protocol, this is when HTTPS is so important. 

- HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, almost the same as HTTP but with security. The purpose is to move very sensitive data from a web browser to a website, the type of data that you don't want other people to get their hands on. If you are doing something online that requires filling out sensitive information, you will always want to use HTTPS instead of HTTPS. To identify if you are on an HTTPS website while in a web browser, you will see the padlock at the very start of the search bar. If your URL bar says "Not secure" you are not on a HTTPS covered by the security of your sensitive information. The way the security works is by using encryption, this is a part of TLS and SSL. 

## Requests 
- The way a request begins is with a Method, the web server can identify a type of Method by looking at the request line. There are many methods they are called Get, Head, Post, Put, Delete, Connect, Options, Trace, and Path. These Methods are so the server knows what data is being fetched depending on which request it is. Requests help find the resource to then receive a response from the server. 

## Rendering
- Rendering is one of the most important parts of web designing, it brings a website to life. The way this works is it takes all the coding languages you have written for your website. Without rendering your code, you wouldn't be able to interact with the website. For example, all your interactive items like drop-down boxes or animations. 

# Developer tools
- Developer tools let see what each part of the code is doing on your website. This is always live so you can untick/tick boxes and see instant results. You should be able to bring it up in a separate browser after you use a shortcut (CTRL, Shift, I, or F12) This will take you to the menu bar just go to more tools and then to Web Developer Tool. Keep in mind that Different browsers will have different steps to open the Developer Tool menu. This is handy as you can physically see where each element is being applied, this way you can change your code if you feel unhappy with your layout.

# Question 4

### Compilers and Interpreter 

- These two have different roles but work together to take the Source Code so it turns into a Machine Code, without this process the computer cannot understand the language clearly. The Interpreter takes the code and turns it into a high-level language this way the Compiler can change it into a machine code. The Compiler has the more important job as it needs to pick up errors and needs to overlook the entire program.

# Question 5

### Python

- Python is a very powerful programming language it is one of the best beginner programming languages to learn. Knowing Python will give you a wide variety of opportunities to be used in a software development role. It is a very easy language to understand and has many benefits but does have its cons, for example, it has a slow Runtime because it follows the code line for line. To get the best use out of Python you should use it for game development, web development, automation, and many more. 

### Javascript

- This is a programming language that allows you to bring complex content to a web page. Anything you see on a website that is interactive or has animations it is probably generated by JavaScript. This language must always run in interpreted order this means it needs to run from top to bottom. JavaScript is great because it not only processes fast but it can run through any browser. The downside to JavaScript is when applications are large they can be harder to process, the code can also become complex when used in different browsers.

# Question 6

### Email:

- Hi Alex,
Thank you so much for getting in touch! I would love to make a website to help your business grow. The first step would be sending me through some of your favorite images of any awesome artifacts, objects, and paraphernalia followed by a description of what each image is. I think this would be a key element to add to the website to help draw the right audience in! Any other information that you believe customers should know before visiting is also essential. For example, the contact number for the venue, address opening/closing times, and what you can see at SAM. I'm thinking of a Stone Age but minimalistic kind of style with light green, black, and white colors. if you would like or have any style in mind, please let me know, I want you to be satisfied with the result. If you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask! Excited to hear back from you and start this website for you.

Kind Regards,

Amy Pearce. 

# Question 7

- My first time doing a tech project was when I had to create my personal website portfolio for this boot camp. It was challenging but along the way, it became easier, I was understanding the languages better with practice. I would do a few things differently if I had to do it again, one of them would be working harder on a draft. I would've then had more of a guide as to what my website would've turned out to be like. I often found myself stuck on deciding the layout and focusing way too much on how it looked rather than if my code was organized correctly. Having a set draft would've made it all a lot easier and smoother sailing. 

# Question 8

## Action Plan:

1. My first goal and step I need to take to progress in this industry is updating my LinkedIn. I have created a page but still need to update my profile picture and add in my projects/experience to showcase my knowledge. I expect to gain a spot in the industry and connect with others through my LinkedIn. I can achieve this by reaching out and responding to other people’s profiles who also want to work in the software development field.

2. My second step would be to reach out to events and look for local workshops, this way I can learn new and important information. Doing this will help gain some connections to other people in the industry, connections are super important in this industry. If you don't know anyone or have connections it could be hard to find work. I am wanting to freelance but it would still be amazing to know others and make those connections. 

3. Doing more research on each topic that I have already learned. I want to be able to have a lot more knowledge and common sense when it comes to coding. Putting this into practice and doing my research will help me gain confidence in myself. Being confident and having muscle memory will make any project super easy to work through. 

4. Showcasing my GitHub, it's a huge step for me but it has a lot of benefits. I tend to doubt my work and compare myself to others, this part is something I'm already slowly starting to work on. The best way to take this step is by sharing my GitHub link with other students and teachers in the industry and asking for some feedback on what I could improve on, so I'm not stuck in the same place.



# Question 9

- Language-learning models work through AI and work as a chat assistant, basically like a bot chat. ChatGPT is one of the common AI models used as it is very easy to use, it's so smart and effective that it feels as though a real person is typing to you live. You could ask the model to write up a short story about something and it will respond and write that story for you. ChatGPT is free to use only if you already have an account with OpenAI as they are the creators.

# Question 10

- The purpose of a Language-learning model is to help a company assist its customers without having to stress, less work means being able to finish and focus on more important projects. ChatGPT is ideal for software development projects because it must have the ability to process corresponding code. It's crucial to be able to process corresponding code so if you have someone that needs to give feedback, they don't need to be a tech wizard.

# Question 11

## Hard Skills

### Programming Languages

- Having this skill is a highly recommended skill to have if you want to become a software developer. When a company is interested in hiring someone the main thing they will look out for is if you know enough languages, without this skill, you're less likely to be successful or hired. It is a high-demand requirement as you can make many programs/websites using Python, HTML, CSS, etc.

### Version Control Systems

- These systems help you keep all your code in check, you can have all your projects in one place. It can be seen by multiple companies/people if you want it to be viewed. This is fantastic to collaborate with others if you are in a workspace and want to show off all your hard work. Version Control Systems are also not something you can learn overnight so having this skill will be impressive to developers. 

### API Integration
- Stands for Application Programming Interface, the purpose is to help different applications talk to each other. API integration is an essential part of a development workplace without it you can't send data to live and connect to external applications. You would need to go through a longer and slower process, more time means more money having to be spent on the company. API Integration is useful in a development workplace because it's quicker and not as time-consuming. If you don't want a company to have as much manual labor it is something to consider. 

## Soft Skills

### Attention to detail 

- This is a key personal skill to have because without your projects can be very messy and may even not work correctly. Attention to detail is all about having a very good eye, if you don't have this skill you will struggle to tell if your code has errors. In software development you may notice your site is not linking or displaying an image, this could be as little as a semi-column has been accidentally put in as a ":". With very good attention to detail, you would pick this up almost instantly. 

### Patience

- Software development is not an easy job you will bump into a lot of problems along the way, having patience is so important because you need to always proofread your code. You must assess and look for where the error is coming from. When working in a team for a software development job always show you are willing to be patient and solve any issues and never give up until you find the answer. 

### Self-motivation

- Majority of time working in software development you must self-manage your projects. Self-motivation is so crucial because no one is going to push you to get your work done, it must all come from you. It can be helpful to manage this by being organized and having set plans, for example using wireframes and Trello. Doing research and looking up to other developers is a great way to stay motivated in this industry as it can be very tough, but by putting in the hard work you will be rewarded.

# Question 12

## Web Developers

- Web development is one of the common and easier roles you can do if you don't want anything too advanced and still want to be in the software development industry. Their job is to create websites and design the look and layout, it can take some skills and a good eye, but some people have the right eye and talent for it. 

## Software Tester

- This role still involves coding and general knowledge of each language because your main focus is to be able to pick up bugs and notice where the errors are taking place. Software testers will go through a website's code to ensure it is all good to be on the internet for everyone to see. 

## DevOps Engineers

- DevOps Engineers will spend their time keeping up-to-date computer servers. To become a DevOps Engineer, you must have very strong communication skills and high-tech experience with knowledge of both coding and scripting. This role is more advanced than an average software development role.
